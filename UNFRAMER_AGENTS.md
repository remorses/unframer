Before starting to work on the user task run `git ls-files | tree --fromfile` to see the structure of the project

The main folder is unframer. This is the core of the codebase, the cli that let you download Unframer components as React code.

Ignore folders like framer-chunks and framer.js which are generated, they contain the Framer website runtime.

Folder that starts with framer- in nextjs-app and other apps are generated by the unframer cli.

Before working on the user task read relevant files inside unframer folder to see how the project works.

## Feedback loop

Running validation of changes

- run `pnpm build` from repo root to start compiling the project (unframer npm package). this script needs to be called every time you change code in unframer/src before testing
- run `pnpm --filter nextjs-app framer-simplicity` to generate the code from Framer using `unframer` tool, code will be put inside nextjs-app/src/framer-simplicity. this is a complex and rich project you can use to see what unframer generates and validate fixes or issues.
- you can also add logs inside unframer/src, then try generating again to inspect data and fields of objects managed by Unframer cli and fix issues.


## fixing issues inside unframer/src/framer.js script

framer.js is a generated script. the script that generates it is inside scripts/download.ts

to run that script you have to run `download-framer:doppler` from root.


## making a new release


to make a new release you should first run the command `pnpm changeset version` in the repo root to apply any previous changeset versions that were added with changeset. This command will also bump the package.json versions and update the changelog file.

for your own changes instead you can just update the CHANGELOG.md file directly and bump the package.json version, then run `pnpm publish` in the right package folder
